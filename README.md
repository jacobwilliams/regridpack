## Brief Description

This is an updated and modernized version of REGRIDPACK, a suite of Fortran routines
for interpolating values between one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional arrays defined
on uniform or nonuniform orthogonal grids. This operation is commonly referred to as "regridding."
Linear or cubic interpolation can be selected independently in each dimension.
Extrapolation is not allowed. The subroutines in REGRIDPACK cannot be used to
transfer values on nonorthogonal (randomly scattered) data grids.
