## Brief Description

This is an updated and modernized version of REGRIDPACK, a suite of Fortran routines
for interpolating values between one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional arrays defined
on uniform or nonuniform orthogonal grids. This operation is commonly referred to as "regridding."
Linear or cubic interpolation can be selected independently in each dimension.
Extrapolation is not allowed. The subroutines in REGRIDPACK cannot be used to
transfer values on nonorthogonal (randomly scattered) data grids.

## Source

The original Fortran 77 version of this code used to be available from UCAR at: http://www.scd.ucar.edu/softlib/REGRIDPACK.html and/or ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/ftp/dsl/lib/regridpack/ but, as of 2019, both links are now dead. It's possible that this library was formerly known as TLCPACK. There were apparently also unit tests programs (trgrd1.f, trgrd2.f, trgrd3.f, trgrd4.f, trgrd1u.f, trgrd2u.f, trgrd3u.f, and trgrd4u.f) that I can't seem to locate. Does anyone have them?

### Compiling

A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) manifest file is included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```

To use `regridpack` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
regridpack = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/regridpack.git" }
```

### Documentation

The API documentation for the current ```master``` branch can be found [here](https://jacobwilliams.github.io/regridpack/).  This is generated by processing the source files with [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford).
